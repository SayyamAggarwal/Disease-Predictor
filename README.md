# 🧠 Disease Predictor: Multi-Disease ML System (Modular & Scalable)

A robust, modular, and production-ready **machine learning system** that predicts the risk of **five major diseases**:

- ❤️ Heart Disease
- 🎗️ Breast Cancer
- 🧪 Kidney Disease
- 🧬 Liver Disease
- 🍭 Diabetes (for women)

Each disease is independently supported with a complete ML lifecycle, including **data ingestion, validation, transformation, training**, and **drift detection**. Built using Flask and deployed on Render with full experiment tracking and model versioning.

🌐 **Live App:** [Try it on Render](https://disease-predictor-dvty.onrender.com/)

## ✨ Key Highlights

- 🔁 **Modular architecture** for each disease
- 🧪 Custom ML pipelines: ingestion → validation → transformation → training
- 🧬 Schema validation and data drift detection
- 📈 **MLflow** for experiment tracking
- 📦 Version control for model/data via **DagsHub**
- 🧾 Clean and responsive UI (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
- 🌍 RESTful backend with Flask, deployed via **Waitress + Render**
- 📊 Logging & error tracking with custom exception handling

## 🔗 ML System Integration

- **ETL pipeline**: Extract from MongoDB → Validate (schema + drift) → Transform → Train
- **MLflow & DagsHub**: Model tracking, artifact versioning
- **Modular Design**: Each disease is a fully independent, pluggable module

---


## 📈 Future Enhancements

- 👥 User authentication & prediction history
- 📁 CSV upload for batch prediction
- 🔍 Model explainability (SHAP, feature importance)
- 🧔 Models for male-specific conditions
- 📊 Monitoring dashboards
